        <h1>Website Shutdown Notice</h1>
        <p>To any staff seeing this message: I'm sincerely sorry if I have caused any trouble within the school environment. There should be no need to pull me in, as I will shut down all operations of this portion of the website <span class="important">for good</span>.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:justincodingprojects+contact@gmail.com">justincodingprojects+contact@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Nobody told me about the implications of doing such a task last year, which is why I have kept it running until now. However, due to my current situation, I will be <span class="important">purging all Eaglercraft files from this website by Friday</span>. I cannot afford any more trouble.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Effective immediately:</strong> I will cease all operations of hosting this game, and I will no longer take responsibility for it. As per request, this website is on lockdown until I can sort things out. If you attempt to access different sections of this website to play Eaglercraft, I strongly advise you to close those tabs to avoid trouble.</p>
        
        <p>I understand that the rules have become stricter, which concerns me not only for my well-being but also for my future.</p>
        
        <h2>Reasons for Shutdown</h2>
        <p>After investigating, I have identified two key reasons why this part of the website will not be coming back:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bypassing Lightspeed Filter:</strong> The website uses a technique that bypasses Lightspeed's filter, violating the districtâ€™s Code of Conduct. This method makes it difficult for Lightspeed to detect certain websites, posing a security risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Piracy:</strong> Eaglercraft is essentially a pirated clone of Minecraft, which is illegal under Florida law. This could lead to serious legal consequences, which is why the district does not allow these types of games.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I sincerely apologize to anyone who has lost progress due to this shutdown, but continuing to play the game will only lead to more trouble. I advise you to close all Eaglercraft tabs immediately.</p>
        
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <p>To clarify a couple of things:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Will it still be available after hours?</strong> No, if you're on the school system, you won't be able to access it, even after hours.</li>
            <li><strong>What about FNF?</strong> While FNF isn't a pirated game, it has been deemed "too inappropriate" by the school, so it won't be coming back either.</li>
            <li><strong>You haven't said much about the <i>server</i> here?</strong> While I (the owner of this site) was the one who made the <i>launcher</i>, I wasn't the one who made the <i>server</i>. Due to this fact there's nothing much I can say about the "server" in question, just that you should probably steer away from it if you have the option to do so.</li>
        </ul>
