    <title>Website Shutdown</title>
</head>
<body>
To any staff seeing this message: I'm sincerely sorry if I have caused any trouble within the school environment. There should be no need to pull me in, as I will shut down all operations of this portion of the website for GOOD.
 <br>
<br>
For contact about this, email <a href="mailto:justincodingprojects+contact@gmail.com">justincodingprojects+contact@gmail.com</a>
<br>
<br>
Nobody told me about the implications of doing such a task last year, hence why I have kept it going up until this year. 
<br>
<br>
Now that I'm in a very unstable place rn: I'll be purging all Eaglercraft files from this website by Friday. I don't need more stuff to incriminate myself yk.
<br>
<br>
And also I will CEASE all operations of hosting this game and I will NOT that responsibility from this point on. 
<br>
<br>
    And as per request...i have put this website on lockdown until I can sort things out. If you try to access different sections of this website to try to play Eaglercraft, I will NOT take responsibility. In fact, I advise you all to CLOSE your Eaglercraft tabs, as I don't want y'all getting in trouble this year. 
<br>
<br>
I can tell the rules have gotten more strict recently, and that makes me get very worried not only for my well-being but also my future.
<br>
<br>
Clarification: it has come to my knowledge that people are getting in trouble for playing Eaglercraft. To avoid further damage, I have shut down this website for the time being.
 <br>
<br>
After investigating, I have boiled this down to 2 reasons why this part of the website probably won't be back up:
 <br>
<br>
1. Bypasses Lightspeed's Filter: This website uses a technique which I dub the "about:blank" method, used by certain unlockers. The problem is that Lightspeed can't detect these types of URIs, making it harder to block the game in general. This also violated the Code of Conduct by 'escaping' their controlled system (by bypassing this filter)
<br>
<br>
Even if I somehow make it work around this, it still would be illegal because of one thing: 
<br>
<br>
2. Piracy: Eaglercraft in itself is essentially a browser-compiled clone of Minecraft. The problem is that it's considered piracy, which is illegal under Florida law, and could get you in serious trouble. Due to this, it makes total sense why the district doesn't allow these types of games (they promote piracy)
<br>
<br>
I'm sincerely sorry if you lost so much progress due to this shutdown, but I'd advise you close any existing Eaglercraft tabs you have to avoid further trouble. 
<br>
<br>
It is not my responsibility if you ignore my request and continue playing this game, as I have said it will get you in trouble if caught. 
<br>
<br>
Most likely this launcher in itself it be shutdown for GOOD, with no point of return. I appreciate all the progress y'all made using this, and even though it pains me to have to shut this down, I did so with good reason.
<br>
<br>
TL;DR: Website bypasses Lightspeed filter and promotes piracy, both of which I don't condone. I advise you to close all tabs of Eaglercraft to avoid further trouble.
 <br>
<br>

<br>

Forgot to say one (actually 2 things) people may wonder:
<br>
<br>
1. "Will it still be on after hours?": No matter how hard you lie to me, if it's on the Chromebook (and therefore on the system), then no, you're not allowed to use it.
<br>
<br>
2. "What's gonna happen to FNF, it isn't a pirated game like Eaglercraft!?": They said it was "too inappropriate"... can't change their decision yk.
<br>
<br>
TL;DR: It won't be on after hours bc you're still on their system and FNF won't come back bc they said it's 'too inappropriate'.
